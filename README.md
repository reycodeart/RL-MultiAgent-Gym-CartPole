# RL Multi-Agent CartPole

This is a simple Reinforcement Learning project where a single and multiple DQN agents are trained on OpenAI Gym's CartPole environment.  
The aim is to demonstrate basic understanding of RL, multi-agent setups, and training analysis.

## Technologies
- Python
- OpenAI Gym
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Files
- `single_agent_dqn.py`: Training of a single agent
- `multi_agent_dqn.py`: Training of 2 agents in parallel (non-cooperative)
- `utils.py`: Shared functions for plotting, logging, etc.

## What I Learned
- How DQN works
- Difference between single-agent and multi-agent setups
- Reward tracking and simple training loops
